 * Section 03 — Master Data Management
 * AUTO-EXTRACTED from src/app/page.tsx — UI preserved exactly.
 *
 * Wire-up layer added on top: live API calls replace mock data arrays,
 * loading/error states added, permission gating added to create buttons.
 * The original JSX structure, classes, colors, icons, and layout are
 * preserved 1:1 so the rendered UI is pixel-identical.
